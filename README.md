# LightBlue Bean iOS Sample App
This is a simple sample app that demonstrates how you can go about interfacing with LightBlue Beans on iOS. Simply open the .xcworkspace file and begin exploring the code.

##About BeanDemo
BeanDemo currently only supports one Bean. It will connect automatically upon startup to any available Beans. You can follow the <a href="https://medium.com/useful-making/bean-ios-tutorial-82265cfb1210">tutorial</a> for this project for more information on how to use it.
